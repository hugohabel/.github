# Hugo Habel

Hi, I'm Hugo. I've been a software engineer for more than 18 years. I've fulfilled different roles throughout my career, including technical lead, and engineering manager. I enjoy guiding junior devs to achieve their best, while remaining open to learning and improving myself. While most of my experience lies on the front-end/mobile development side, I'm currently working toward becoming a full stack dev (front-end, back-end, and mobile)
