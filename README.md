# Hugo Habel

Hi, I'm Hugo – I'm a **senior software developer** with more than 13 years of experience, of which I spent the last 2 years fulfilling the duties of a **technical lead**. Then I had the opportunity to become a **software engineering manager** and to this day, I have more than 2 years of experience. My area of expertise is **front-end** development.

I have experience in the **full process of software development**, from requirements to release, from *small* to **large** scale applications. I have worked at some start-ups as well as at larger corporations, which means I have been part of amazing teams. 

I have experience **working**, **leading**, and **managing** *local* and **globally distributed** teams.
