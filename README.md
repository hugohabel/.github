# Hugo Habel

Hi, I'm Hugo – I'm a senior software engineer with more than 15 years of experience. As part of my career, I have fulfilled the roles of technical lead, and engineering manager. My area of expertise is front-end development with React, and I’m in the process of immersing myself into native iOS development with Swift. I have experience in the entire process of software development, from requirements to release, in both small and large scale applications. I have worked at some start-ups as well as at larger corporations, always being part of amazing teams.
