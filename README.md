## Portfolio

I decided to focus my portfolio on the area that attracts my interest the most, web front-end, and iOS development. To get more information about each project, please refer to their README.md file (when available), or send me a message to request access to the repository.

- [Amelia Start Page](https://hugohabel.github.io/amelia-start-page/) ‚Äì This project showcases my abilities in web front-end with React.js and TypeScript. It includes automated tests with Jest and react-testing-library. *This project is in a very early stage, and is still a work in progress*.

### SwiftUI Portfolio

*All the apps in this section are just small projects to practice my abilities with SwiftUI. They are by no means a full project or a complete app.*
